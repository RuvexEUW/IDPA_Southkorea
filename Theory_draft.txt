1. Introduction

Why this project (tour guide/blog on South Korea)?

Relevance: many young people (20‚Äì30) are interested in K-pop, Korean food, and travel.

Research question/thesis: Which text types are best suited for a digital platform that introduces places, food, and culture of South Korea?

You should write this yourselves:

Your motivation (Why South Korea? Personal interests? Inspiration?)

How you came up with the idea of creating your own website.

üëâ You should add your own examples: Which terms you want to include in the glossary (e.g., Hanbok, Bibimbap, K-Drama, Kimchi).

3. Website Structure and Justification

Combination of text types: Travel guide (facts), Blog (emotions), Glossary (understanding).

Why this structure makes sense: It appeals to both information-seekers and culture/inspiration-seekers.

Logical flow: Homepage ‚Üí Blog entries (as an engaging entry point) ‚Üí Subpages (Food, Places, Culture) ‚Üí Glossary as a support tool.

üëâ You should add: Your planned menu structure, categories, and subpages.

4. Differences and Comparison of the Text Types

Travel Guide: objective, fact-based.

Blog: subjective, storytelling.
