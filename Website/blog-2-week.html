                        South Korea had been on my travel list for a long time.
                        I’d always been fascinated by its mix of old and new — ancient palaces next to neon-lit gaming
                        cafés,
                        the smell of street food drifting through modern city streets, and the rhythm of a culture that
                        feels both futuristic and deeply traditional.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This spring, I finally spent <strong>two unforgettable</strong> weeks traveling through the
                        country with a friend
                        —
                        from Seoul’s bustling neighbourhoods to Gyeongju’s historic treasures, Busan’s coastal charm,
                        and Jeonju’s traditional beauty.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This blog tells the story of that trip:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>what we did</li>
                        <li>what we ate</li>
                        <li>where we stayed</li>
                        <li>and the small moments in between</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        At the same time, I hope it can serve <strong>as inspiration and a practical reference</strong>
                        for anyone planning their own journey through South Korea.

                        This post is structured as a <strong>day-by-day itinerary</strong>, but you don’t have to follow
                        it exactly. <br>
                        You can:

                        <strong>Route:</strong> Seoul → Gyeongju → Busan → Jeonju → Seoul <br>
                        <strong>Best for:</strong> Young adults (20–30) who want a mix of culture, food, nightlife,
                        gaming, and history
                    </p>


                    <h4 class="mt-5">Rough structure:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Days 1-5:</strong> Seoul (Insadong, Myeongdong, Hongdae, Gangnam, Seongsu)</li>
                        <li><strong>Days 6-7:</strong> Gyeongju (history + temples)</li>

                    </ul>


                    <h4 class="mt-5">Budget:</h4>
                    <p>
                        South Korea is not the cheapest place on earth, but as a Swiss person, it definitely feels
                        cheaper compared to Switzerland.
                        You can get a very good dinner for about <strong>5–10 CHF</strong>, including drinks.
                        I spent about <strong>700 CHF</strong> for two weeks in South Korea, which amounts to roughly
                        <strong>1,277,698 won</strong>.
                        I paid around <strong>1,053 CHF</strong> for direct flights with Korean Air, and <strong>600
                            CHF</strong> for all the hotels. <br>
                        So my total expenses for these two weeks were around <strong>2,500 CHF</strong> — and that was
                        with a very comfortable lifestyle.
                    </p>


                    <h4 class="mt-5">When to visit:</h4>
                    <p>
                        We went in April, and I would highly recommend it because of the mild temperatures — usually
                        around <strong>15–25°C</strong> — and the overall pleasant weather.
                        I would discourage visiting in the peak summer months because of the heat and humidity.
                        That said, every season in South Korea has its own charm and atmosphere.
                    </p>


                    <h4 class="mt-5">Transportation:</h4>
                    <p>
                        I recommend buying a <strong>T-Money card</strong> at the start of your trip.
                        It works for almost all buses and metros, and you can get one in most convenience stores.
                        If you need to catch a bullet train (KTX) from Seoul to Busan, the best option is to go to the
                        station one day before your trip and buy the ticket at the counter. <br>
                        For navigation, use <strong> Google Maps and Kakao Maps</strong> — I recommend using both
                        because they sometimes show different routes.
                        Public transport can take you almost everywhere, and taxis are also available, although they are
                        not always the cheapest option. <br>
                        <strong>Our train times with the KTX (bullet train):</strong>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Seoul Station → Gyeongju Station: <strong>2 h 20 min</strong></li>
                        <li>Gyeongju Station → Busan Station: <strong>30 min</strong></li>
                        <li>Busan Station → Jeonju Station: <strong>2 h 58 min</strong></li>
                        <li>Jeonju Station → Seoul Station: <strong>1 h 59 min</strong></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        We landed at <strong>Seoul Incheon Airport</strong> around 2 p.m. and caught a train to our
                        hotel in <strong>Insadong</strong>, a very central area of Seoul that is still relatively quiet.
                        It’s a great base because it’s close to historic sights like <strong>Gyeongbokgung
                            Palace</strong>, and not too far from <strong>Myeongdong</strong>,
                        which is busy and full of life day and night. <br>
                        That afternoon and evening, we explored <strong>Myeongdong’s</strong> alleys, tried
                        <strong>Korean BBQ</strong>, and ended the night in a small local bar.
                        The energy of the city hit us instantly — loud, colourful, and alive.

                            The location was superb, so I would highly recommend it.

                    <h3 class="mt-5">Day 2: Palaces and Hanok Villages</h3>
                    <p>
                        We started the morning exploring <strong>Bukchon Hanok Village</strong>, a neighbourhood full of
                        traditional Korean houses between <strong>Gyeongbokgung</strong> and
                        <strong>Changdeokgung</strong> Palaces.
                        Walking there felt like time-travel — from modern streets to old alleys and tiled roofs.<br>
                        Even though it’s a cool place to visit, I was slightly disappointed. It felt more like a regular
                        neighbourhood than the fully “traditional” atmosphere I had expected, but it was still worth
                        seeing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Later, we visited <strong>Gyeongbokgung</strong> and <strong>Changdeokgung Palaces</strong>,
                        learning about Korea’s royal history and architecture.
                        You can stroll around quite freely and there’s a lot of information to take in — from the
                        Japanese occupation to the development of the palace complexes.
                        There, you can also witness a traditional reenactment of the Joseon Dynasty’s royal
                        guard-changing ceremony. Entry tickets cost 3’000 Won each.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the afternoon, we went to the <strong>T1 Basecamp in Hongdae</strong>, an esports center
                        popular among gaming enthusiasts.
                        We had a light lunch, played a few matches, and enjoyed the vibrant atmosphere of the esports
                        community.<br>
                        Later, we explored the <strong>Insadong</strong> area near our hotel and discovered a hidden gem
                        of a restaurant — <strong>Insadong Maneul Bossam</strong>.
                        They served traditional set meals with Bossam (boiled pork belly) and spring onion pancakes,
                        which were absolutely delicious.
                        Paired with a savoury chestnut makgeolli, it was the perfect way to end the evening.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our third day was something completely different: the <strong>DMZ Tour</strong> near the North
                        Korean border.
                        It was an emotional and educational experience — learning about the history and tension between
                        the two Koreas left a deep impression.
                        We took a guided tour from <strong>GetYourGuide</strong>, which I highly recommend.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Back in Seoul, we relaxed at <strong>Yeouido Hangang Park</strong>, where a street food festival
                        was happening.
                        Locals picnicked by the river, couples biked past, and live music played as the sun set.
                        We ate corn dogs, tteokbokki, fried chicken, and for dessert some delicious hotteok.

                    <p>
                        We hiked up to <strong>N Seoul Tower</strong> in the morning. The trail was calm and green,
                        offering amazing views once we reached the top.
                        We grabbed a quick breakfast at Starbucks in the tower and used the time to plan the rest of our
                        day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Afterwards, we walked back through the <strong>Namsan Botanical Garden</strong>, enjoyed the
                        relaxed atmosphere, and even chatted with a Korean grandpa about Seoul.
                        Then we took the subway towards <strong>Seongsu</strong>.<br>
                        Seongsu is full of indie cafés, art shops, and street murals. We had lunch at <strong>Seongsu
                            Darak</strong>, explored <strong>Seoul Forest Park</strong> full of cherry blossoms and the
                        deer corral,
                        and then went shopping for some vintage clothing (which was a bit challenging for my rather
                        large build).
                        We ended the day with ramen at <strong>Nirou Mian Guan</strong>, a place with multiple Michelin
                        awards.

                    <p>
                        We spent the day in <strong>Gangnam</strong>, Seoul’s modern and stylish district.
                        After a late breakfast at <strong>Cheonsang Gaok</strong>, where we enjoyed their delicious salt
                        bread. We decided to skip lunch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The contrast throughout the day was striking: we began at <strong>Bongeunsa Temple</strong>, a
                        serene space surrounded by skyscrapers, lush nature, and an impressive standing Buddha statue.
                        We then visited the <strong>Starfield Library inside the COEX Mall</strong> — a dreamlike place
                        for book lovers — and made a quick stop at the <strong>Gangnam Style statue</strong>, an iconic
                        photo spot just
                        outside the mall.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the afternoon, we walked through the <strong>Seolleung and Jeongneung Royal Tombs</strong>, a
                        peaceful and green historic site hidden in the middle of the city.
                        For dinner, we went to <strong>Oncheonjip</strong>, a restaurant well known for its excellent
                        shabu shabu.

                    <h3 class="mt-5">Day 6: History Comes Alive in Gyeongju</h3>
                    <p>
                        Early in the morning, we took the train to <strong>Gyeongju</strong>, often called Korea’s
                        “museum without walls.” The city is full of historical treasures.<br>
                        We began at the <strong>Gyeongju National Museum</strong>, which presents Korea’s history from
                        the Bronze Age to the Unified Silla period, displaying ancient artifacts, statues, and massive
                        ceremonial bells.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We continued to <strong>Banwolseong</strong>, a forested archaeological site where many ancient
                        artifacts have been discovered.
                        This area includes the remains of the old Silla fortress and offers a peaceful walk through
                        nature.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another stop was <strong>Cheomseongdae Observatory</strong>, one of Korea’s most famous historic
                        landmarks.
                        Surrounded by flower fields, it looks almost like a giant stone furnace rising from the ground.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also explored the <strong>Tomb of King Michu of Silla</strong>, part of a royal burial
                        complex from the Silla era.
                        You can even enter one of the tombs to see the interior structure, which was incredibly
                        impressive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Later, we saw <strong>Woljeonggyo Bridge</strong>, which was another highlight of the day.
                        We also visited this in the evening, and I can only recommend it — the bridge glows beautifully
                        in the shimmering lights, creating a perfect photo spot.
                        You can even cross the river on stepping stones and admire the view from below.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From there, we visited <strong>Wolji Pond</strong>, known for its beautiful pavilions, pagodas,
                        and surrounding nature.
                        I especially recommend visiting in the evening — the entire area is illuminated in a mysterious,
                        atmospheric light accompanied by soft music.<br>
                        It was one of my favourite days — a perfect blend of nature, history, and culture.

                        While you’re there, you can also try Hwangnam-ppang, a local Gyeongju specialty

                        To reach <strong>Seokguram Grotto</strong>, you can either take the shuttle bus up the mountain
                        or walk the entire way.
                        I highly recommend taking the bus up and then walking back down afterward — the trail is
                        peaceful and offers beautiful views.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Later, we visited <strong>Jungdo Tower</strong>, which rises impressively over the surrounding
                        village.
                        Afterwards, we walked around the serene <strong>Bomun Lake</strong> and took a break at
                        <strong>Page 9 Café</strong>, a perfect spot to rest and enjoy the view.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the evening, we took the bus back to central Gyeongju. We wandered through the
                        <strong>Gyochon Traditional Village</strong>, filled with restaurants, tea houses, and small
                        shops —
                        a great place to rest, eat, and explore traditional Korean culture. Then we had dinner at
                        <strong>Tiger Katsu</strong>, a restaurant known for serving delicious Japanese-style pork
                        katsu.

                    <p>
                        The next morning, we took the train to <strong>Busan</strong> and checked into our hotel in the
                        <strong>Sinchang-dong</strong> district.
                        We spent the first part of the day at <strong>Haeundae Beach</strong> and explored the nearby
                        <strong>Haeundae Traditional Market</strong>, which was full of snacks and local specialties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For a spectacular view of the coastline, we visited <strong>Busan X the SKY</strong> and went up
                        to the 101st floor, nearly 400 meters above ground.
                        The panorama from up there was incredible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Later, we rode the <strong>Haeundae Blueline Park</strong> train for stunning coastal views
                        before heading to the <strong>Haedong Yonggungsa Temple</strong>.
                        This temple is built directly on the cliffs overlooking the sea, making it one of the most
                        unique temple settings in Korea.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the evening, we returned to our district and had dinner at a traditional restaurant, where we
                        enjoyed a comforting kimchi stew.

                    <h3 class="mt-5">Day 9: Culture and Coastlines</h3>
                    <p>
                        The next day was all about culture and colour. We started early and took a bus to
                        <strong>Taejongdae Park</strong>, where we spent the morning walking through nature and enjoying
                        incredible views of the cliffs and the ocean.
                        We also grabbed a few snacks near the lighthouse before heading back.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the afternoon, we visited <strong>Gamcheon Culture Village</strong>, a place with a
                        completely different atmosphere from the rest of Busan.
                        It’s artistic, vibrant, and slightly chaotic in a way that feels both nostalgic and unique.
                        We stopped at <strong>DUF Coffee</strong> for an iced latte during our walk, which was a great
                        break in the middle of all the exploring.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Part of Gamcheon’s charm comes from its history — the village was shaped by families who settled
                        there during difficult times, including refugees from the North, which gives the area a special
                        cultural background.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the evening, we went to <strong>BIFF Square</strong> and had dakgalbi, which ended up being
                        one of my favourite meals of the entire trip.

                    <p>
                        The next morning, we took the train to <strong>Jeonju</strong>, which took about two hours since
                        there is no direct connection from Busan.
                        Jeonju is famous for its <strong>Hanok Village</strong> and rich food culture, so we were
                        excited to explore.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our first stop was <strong>Gyeonggijeon Shrine</strong>, where you can walk around freely and
                        enjoy the peaceful atmosphere and traditional architecture.
                        For lunch, we tried a viral spot called <strong>Goof-Off</strong>, known for its Italian–Korean
                        fusion dishes, which turned out to be surprisingly good.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the afternoon, we visited <strong>Jeondong Cathedral</strong> and <strong>Nambu
                            Market</strong>, then wandered through streets filled with people wearing traditional
                        hanbok, which gave the whole area a lively and festive feeling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For dinner, we chose a small, very traditional family-run restaurant. It was just a father,
                        mother, and their daughter running the place — and they served some truly delicious home-style
                        cold noodles.

                            The And Spring Airbnb was fantastic. It was quite small, but the location makes up for it,
                            you can’t be more in the centre of Jeonju.
                            Since you won’t spend much time in the room anyway, it’s perfect. I highly recommend this

                    <!--  Day 11  -->
                    <h3 class="mt-5">Day 11: Hikes and Hidden Corners</h3>
                    <p>
                        Today, we hiked <strong>Gilinbong Mountain</strong>, where the fresh air and peaceful nature
                        made the climb incredibly enjoyable.
                        From the top, you get a beautiful view over the Hanok Village, which feels especially unique
                        from above.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the hike, we explored the ruins of <strong>Donggosanseong Fortress</strong>.
                        The site is quite large, and you can still see sections of the old walls scattered across the
                        mountain, giving a strong sense of the area’s historical scale.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Later, we walked around <strong>Ajung Lake</strong> and relaxed with matcha cheesecake and an
                        iced matcha latte.
                        The matcha was sourced from Jeju Island, which made the experience even more special.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the afternoon, we continued through <strong>Jaman Mural Village</strong> to
                        <strong>Omokdae</strong>, a viewpoint that offers a closer look over the Hanok Village and
                        surrounding scenery.
                        Afterwards, we walked along the river and had a friendly conversation with some locals, who
                        recommended a place for dinner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before eating, we stopped by <strong>VIBRA</strong>, a vintage shop where we found some great
                        pieces.
                        For dinner, we went to <strong>Ondam</strong>, a restaurant known for its premium Korean pork
                        BBQ — and it was absolutely fantastic.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="mt-5">Day 12: Hongdae Nights</h3>
                    <p>
                        Back in Seoul, we explored <strong>Hongdae</strong>, an area known for its street performances,
                        vibrant art scene, and lively nightlife.
                        We also visited <strong>Haneul Park</strong>, famous for its vast open fields and panoramic
                        views over the city.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For lunch, we stopped by a Michelin Guide–listed ramen restaurant, which was absolutely
                        outstanding.
                        Afterwards, we spent some time walking along the <strong>Hongdae Shopping Street</strong>,
                        browsing the shops and soaking up the energetic atmosphere.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the evening, we joined a pub crawl and met new friends — Lydia from Taiwan and Bruno from the
                        Netherlands.
                        We visited four different clubs and bars together and ended up dancing until 3 a.m.

                        <p>
                            The hotel was excellent — friendly staff and a surprisingly large room for Seoul.
                            The only downside was the location, which wasn’t within walking distance of most places I
                            wanted to visit.
                            However, with a metro station right around the corner, it wasn’t a big issue.

                    <h3 class="mt-5">Day 13: Calm Corners of Seoul</h3>
                    <p>
                        After a late morning, I visited the <strong>Cheongun Literature Library</strong> and the
                        <strong>Hill of Poet Yun Dong-ju</strong> — quiet, reflective places that reveal a calmer and
                        more contemplative side of the city.
                        Near these two sights, there is an art museum that blends traditional and modern styles.
                        <strong>Seokpajeong</strong> features impressive works of art as well as a beautiful garden and
                        a small temple area at the top.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Afterwards, I took the bus to <strong>Café Pokpo</strong>, which offers a variety of drinks and
                        snacks.
                        The highlight is the view: you can sit outside and watch the waterfall flowing directly behind
                        the café.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I finished the day gaming with Bruno at the <strong>T1 Base Camp</strong>.
                        Bruno had an account that allowed us to play on the Korean server — something usually not
                        possible due to South Korean gaming regulations — which made the experience even more fun and
                        unique.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Later in the evening, I met Lydia for dinner, and we enjoyed some incredible soba noodles
                        together.

                    <p>
                        We almost missed our flight to Zurich because we overslept — classic.
                        With some quick thinking and a taxi driver who must have been secretly training for Formula 1,
                        we made it to <strong>Incheon Airport</strong> just in time.
                        We were so late that we couldn’t even check in our luggage, so we had to drag everything through
                        security.
                        I ended up losing a few souvenirs and my razor blades, which security definitely didn’t
                        appreciate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Still, we somehow reached the gate with only five minutes left before boarding.
                        Completely out of breath and sweating, we collapsed into our seats as the plane took off.
                        Watching Seoul shrink beneath the clouds, it hit me how much these two weeks meant.

                    <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
                    <p>These two weeks in South Korea combined everything I love about travel:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>History and culture</strong>that you can feel in the streets</li>
                        <li><strong>Food</strong>that you still think about months later</li>
                        <li><strong>People and moments</strong>that turn into stories you keep telling</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        If you’re in your twenties, curious about East Asia, and open to mixing palaces, gaming cafés,
                        beaches, bars,
                        temples, and street food, South Korea is the perfect place to start.
                        If I had more time, I would have invested 1 week on Jeju Island, visiting the mountains and the
                        Beaches. Aside from that,
                        i would also have liked to have more time in Seoul, so I could do some daytrips from there.
                        If you’re in South Korea for the first time, I would recommend staying flexible — things will
                        never go exactly as planned,
                        so just walk around, explore, and let things happen naturally. And be sure to have some cash on
                        you: most places accept card,
                        but some remote shops only accept cash.
