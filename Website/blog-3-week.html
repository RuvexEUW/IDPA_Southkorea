                            Like many vacations, mine started with the task of getting there first. It is a long flight, between 13-15 hours to be exact.
                            It’s not my first time flying this distance so I’m not very anxious and I’m already accustomed to the whole process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This time we split the flight into two parts. First, we fly to Istanbul in Turkey where we will transfer to a connecting flight which will go straight to Incheon in Korea. 
                            Over the year my mother and I often split the flight into two parts because it’s cheaper this way.

                        <p>
                            We arrived at 10 in the morning in Korea. First thing we did after we got off the flight and recovered our baggage was to go get some coffee in a nearby coffee shop.
                            After checking in in our hotel we went to <strong>Gwangjang market</strong> in the middle of Seoul, an old but iconic market with tons of street food vendors and many little alleys branching off where you can find many different things. Highly recommended to check it out.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We also went to the <strong>COEX</strong>, a big shopping mall, with a big library right in the middle of it. It’s the perfect place to do some shopping and have some impressive visuals at the same time.
                            In the evening, we roamed around the streets in <strong>Hongdae</strong>. These streets are always busy but they really come alive in the evening. Many young people come here in the evening and either do shopping, go to karaoke or even do street performances.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="mt-5">Day 2: <span class="wiki-term" data-term="N Seoul Tower">Namsan Tower</span> and Korean BBQ</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our second day started with us visiting a shop we visited often in the morning from now on. It called <strong>“Paris Baguette”</strong>, a chain brand, and it is a little shop with a lot of different baked goods, coffee, juice, cake and more.
                            It’s a perfect place for us western people to get our breakfast we’re so used to. The only problem we had was that most things were sweet, the only thing that wasn’t sweetened or glazed/covered in sugar was the baguette.
                            Still, I recommend this place for anyone that is looking for a simple breakfast with some bread and jam and some coffee to go along with.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today’s plan is to visit the <strong><span class="wiki-term" data-term="N Seoul Tower">Namsan Tower</span></strong>, also called the Seoul Tower. It is stationed in the center of Seoul on top of a slightly larger hill called Namsan mountain.
                            And as we found out, there are quite a few ways to get up to the tower because every time we went up that mountain we took a different path.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The way we took was a rather steep and direct stairway practically from the bottom straight to the top. It didn’t really provide a view of the city because it led through a forest and was also quite an exhausting exercise, but it was still a nice path and also quite fast.
                            Once on top of the mountain we of course also went up the tower and at the top awaited a fantastic overview of the whole city of Seoul.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the evening, we went to eat <strong>Korean BBQ</strong> to close out the day. Just be careful if you don’t eat pork because not all BBQ-places also offer beef to grill.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="mt-5" id="jeju">Day 3: Arrival in Jeju</h3>
                        <p>
                            On the 3rd day we flew to Jeju-do. We could leave most of our luggage in Seoul and could travel with lighter baggage.
                            Getting on the flight and the flight itself were pretty nice and went without problems. Just when we arrived in Jeju we ran into a problem.
                            Thing is, we rented a car to be a bit more independent and drive around Jeju, but we couldn’t find the car rental facility anywhere. Turns out you need to take a specific Shuttlebus that takes you to the correct car rental company.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After we found that out, we could claim our car and went to the city to check into our Hotel. For the rest of the day, we explored Jeju city a bit more and went into a small restaurant to eat dinner. There we had a simple bibimbap and some Mandu.

                        <h3 class="mt-5">Day 4: Traveling around the Northside of Jeju</h3>
                        <p>
                            On the 4th day we went sightseeing around the island and stopped by various locations. First stop was a very nice little beach, <strong>Kimnyeong beach</strong>, on the north side of the island. The beach was very clean and there were not many people. It was even warm enough to go swimming.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After that we visited our next stop, that one being <strong>Maze Land</strong>, a maze garden and museum where we spent some time finding our way through the mazes and exploring the park.
                            Our last stop for the day was the <strong>Seongsan Ilchulbong</strong>, a small vulcanic crater you can hike up. We did not do it this time because it was already getting late but it was still impressive to see this mountain from the bottom.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="mt-5">Day 5: Traveling around the Southside of Jeju</h3>
                        <p>
                            We spent our third day on Jeju-do similar to our second day by going to various destinations on the island, but this time in the south of the island.
                            First stop was <strong>Songak-san</strong>, which not only was a beautiful trail, but also provided a nice ocean view.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After that we went to look at a Buddhistic temple in the area, called the <strong>Sangbansan Bomunsa temple</strong>. It really felt like the time there had stopped, and you could get some insight into the old days of Korea. If you are in the area, I’d recommend you take a look.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As for our third place to visit, that was the <strong>Cheonjeyon Waterfalls</strong>. Like many other destinations in Jeju, it was a nice experience but sadly also not quite complete because one of the big waterfalls wasn’t actually flowing. There were still many other spots and views that delivered so the trip was still worth it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On our way back to our hotel we stopped at a restaurant called <strong>Jeju Yechan</strong> to try the Jeju famous black Pork. The thing we ordered was a real feast and also really tasty.

                        <p>
                            Today we flew from Jeju-do back to mainland Korea to Busan, one of the biggest coastal cities of Korea. We did not do much today, most time was spent sleeping in, packing our stuff and waiting at the airport.
                            We had some time left to spend in the evening which we used to explore the <strong>Gwangbok-ro fashion street</strong>. It felt like Hongdae in Seoul, just a little smaller. There we also ate some Katsu-don for dinner.

                        <p>
                            Today we went to the <strong>Busan tower</strong>. It’s similar to the <span class="wiki-term" data-term="N Seoul Tower">Seoul tower</span> but quite a bit smaller in comparison. It also has a park beneath it to walk through which was enjoyable.
                            After that we spent most of the day at the <strong>Jagalchi fish market</strong>. Busan is famous for this market. Here you have vendors with all sorts of fish and ocean-related food.
                            The specialty is that you can go to a vendor, tell them which fish or seafood you want to eat and how and then take the live creature out of the tank and send it up to a kitchen where it is served very fresh. We of course did that and took a fish and a king crab, which were both very delicious. Highly recommended.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the evening, we went to Gwangbok-ro again, where we ate some Bingsu as dessert.

                        <p>
                            On this day we went to <strong>Haeundae</strong>, the modern part of Busan, where we checked out several things.
                            First up was the <strong>Cheongsapo Daritol Skywalk</strong>. This is a bridge-like structure with a glass floor that leads out towards the ocean, loops around and comes back to the shore. It’s a fun little experience staring down 15 meters into the ocean.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Next up was <strong>Busan x The Sky</strong>, a viewpoint on the 100th floor of one of the tallest buildings in Busan. We had some problems with finding the entrance, but it did provide a better view than the Busan tower.
                            The dinner we had was one of the best I had all my stay. It was Dakgalbi at a place called <strong>Premium Dakgalbi</strong>. The food is delicious, and I highly recommend checking it out.

                            It was Chuseok, Korea's national harvest holiday, so most of the nation was closed and spending time with the family.
                            So as you can imagine, we didn’t do much today, just went to Haeundae again and spent some time at the beach.

                            This day was also pretty uneventful, because we spent all day traveling. At first it was planned we take the high-speed train back to Seoul, but because of Chuseok all the trains were booked out and the agency that should organize the tickets offered the solution to travel back per bus.
                            Little did we know we would be on the road for 11 hours instead of 6 because of all the traffic also because of Chuseok.

                        <p>
                            Today we met up with some friends at the <strong>Gwangjang market</strong>. We went through the market again and had some Tteokbukki and Kimbap. This time I also got myself a hanbok, the traditional Korean clothing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Next up after that we went to <strong>Hanok Bukchon village</strong>, an area in Seoul that is still like in the style of the old times, with traditional houses. It’s a very popular tourist spot and to be honest it’s kinda overrated. With all the people there it’s not very enjoyable.
                            On our way back we stopped at the <strong>KFM-Center</strong>, a museum that shows the basics of Korean food culture and how it was traditionally made. The entry is free so if you plan to visit this Hanok village, I recommend you also check this out.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Next stop was <strong>Insadong</strong>. This is another one of the big markets of Seoul. Insadong is just a street with shops left and right where you can find nearly everything. Its one of my favorite Spots in Seoul and I recommend visiting.
                            In the evening, we roamed around in Hongdae again and tried the karaoke.

                        <p>
                            Today we went to the <strong>T1 Headquarters</strong>. T1 is one if not Koreas biggest E-sports organization and is especially famous for League of Legends. So, if you’re not a big E-sports or LoL fan, it’s probably not that interesting.
                            But if you are interested, I do recommend checking it out. The T1 Headquarters include a gift shop and a café where you can find all of the trophies and achievements displayed and also some other niche things that might be interesting for a fan.

                        <h3 class="mt-5" id="east-coast">Day 13: Shopping Day in Gangneung</h3>
                        <p>
                            Today we went to <strong>Gangneung</strong> by train. Gangneung is a coastal city in the east part of korea. We spent our day travelling there by train in the morning and then explore the city a bit more in the afternoon.
                            Upon arrival we found out that Gangneung was part of the 2018 Winter Olympics that happened in korea, so there are quite a few destinations with that as its theme.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Upon wandering around in the direction of the <strong>Gangneung Jungang Market</strong> a bit more we found some small, beautiful little spots to take some pictures. But our main goal was the market. It was similar to the Gwangjang market of Seoul, just a little smaller and there were a lot more local specialties you can buy.
                            After spending the rest of the afternoon there we went back to the hotel and only stopped at a small restaurant to eat Yukgaejang for dinner.

                        <p>
                            Starting off the day, we went to eat something for breakfast and found this little café called <strong>“A brick”</strong> near the main station of Gangneung. It’s a small café run by an elderly lady and they made some of the best waffles, cakes and coffee I’ve ever had.
                            The atmosphere is very calm, and the lady is very sweet. I highly recommend checking it out if you’re ever in Gangneung.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because it was raining very heavily today we went to the <strong>Gyongpo Aquarium</strong> and explored that for a while. Honestly, it was bigger and better than I expected and we even were there at the right time to witness feeding time of the otters and penguins.

                        <p>
                            The plan today was to go to <strong>Donghae</strong> and visit some tourist destinations there. We wanted to go Cheongok Golden Bat Cave, but for some reason it was closed, so we had to come up with an alternative.
                            We decided that we could check out the <strong>Hanseom beach</strong> and then take a walk along the shores. It was a nice trail with some beautiful views of the ocean. Sadly, the weather wasn’t that great so we could not enjoy it to the fullest.

                        <h3 class="mt-5">Day 16: Jeongdongjin</h3>
                        <p>
                            Today we went to <strong>Jeongdongjin</strong>. It’s another small coastal city that has nonetheless some places of interest. After we got off the train, we had to walk a bit to reach the city center.
                            We walked along the way through the <strong>Hourglass Park</strong>, a park dedicated to old time-measuring devices like sundials and hourglasses. The centerpiece of the park is a giant Hourglass that takes one year to fully deplete.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because the thing Jeongdongjin is most famous for is the hotel on a hill that is built like a cruise ship. The <strong>“Sun Cruise Hotel”</strong> is a ship on a hill that makes for an impressive visual towering on that hill.
                            Up-close the hotel really does look like a real cruise ship with all the details. It has also garden structure surrounding it with some viewpoint to take photos.

                        <p>
                            Today was packed again with sightseeing. First on the agenda was the <strong>Yonsei University</strong>, one of the biggest universities in Korea. The whole campus is the size of a small village and mostly open to the public. And let me tell you it was impressive.
                            After that we craved some fried chicken, so we looked around for a bit and found a fried chicken restaurant pretty quick. Korea is famous for fried chicken and it lived up to the expectations because it was really good.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Next on the list was the <strong>Namdaemun market</strong>, another one of Seoul’s biggest markets. Namdaemun is a big street market with many of the stalls selling clothing, food, cookware and medicine and supplements.
                            It’s a rather cheap environment but the quality is still quite good.

                        <h3 class="mt-5">Day 19: Han River Drone Show</h3>
                        <p>
                            Today was something rather big planned. Seoul hosted a drone show every week during fall, stationed at the <strong>Jamsil Hangang park</strong> during the evening.
                            But we still had some time to kill till then so we went to the Coex once again and after that we watched a live LoL Worlds match in the T1 Café that was located right next to the headquarters.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Anyway, for the main attraction of the day, the <strong>drone show</strong> was starting soon. The entry is free so it was pretty clear that there would be many people.
                            The drone show itself was quite the spectacle and my first time actually seeing something like that in person. The theme was Kakao Friends, the mascots of a very popular messenger service in Korea.

                        <h3 class="mt-5">Day 20: LoL Park and Gwanghwamun Square</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our last day in Seoul we visited <strong>LoL Park</strong>, the big center of LoL E-sports in Seoul. Once again this is more something for LoL fans but it’s still interesting to give it a visit, even if you aren’t a fan. It’s located near Insadong and Gwanghwamun Square.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the rest of the day, we visited the <strong>Gwanghwamun square</strong> and its surroundings. This is the square in front of the <strong><span class="wiki-term" data-term="Gyeongbokgung Palace">Gyeongbeokung palace</span></strong>, one of the biggest temples in Korea. Even though the temple is the main attraction, the square also left quite an impression.

                        <h3 class="mt-5">Day 21: Incheon City</h3>
                        <p>
                            On our last day in Korea, we went to airport in the morning and checking in our suitcases. The plan for today is to explore Incheon a bit and spend the time there until our flight in the evening.
                            We took the bus to <strong>Incheon City</strong> and wandered around a bit with no real destinations. Incheon gave off a whole other vibe in comparison to everything I have seen before.
                            We eventually reached <strong>Songdo Central Park</strong> and walked through that park. It was a really beautiful park but once again it was strangely empty. There we also found Hollys Café where we settled in until we had to leave for the airport again.

                            This 3-week journey was an incredible mix of city life, nature, and e-sports culture. From the busy streets of Seoul to the calm beaches of Jeju and Gangneung, every day offered something new.
